## Git Commit Message Convention

### Commit Message Structure
```
- A commit message consists of a title and a body.
- The title and body are separated by a blank line.
- The title should not exceed 50 characters.
- Write the title in imperative mood, starting with a capital letter.
- Do not end the title with a period.
- Use a summary format for the title and provide more detailed explanations in the body.
```

### Title (Subject)
- The title summarizes the changes.
- Use appropriate verbs and nouns to write concise and clear titles.
- Follow this format:
  - `Add feature X`
  - `Fix issue Y`
  - `Update documentation`

### Body
- The body provides detailed explanations of the changes.
- Insert a blank line between the title and the body.
- Describe the reasons, background, and impact of the changes.
- Keep the body under 72 characters per line, and limit each line to 80 characters.
- Include relevant issue references or links if necessary.
